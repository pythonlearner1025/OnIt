Project Name: OnIt
Short Description: OnIt is a focus-management desktop application that allows you to track your focus by tracking where you look on the screen. Attention is closely related to vision, and your focus can be closely approximated by tracking how consistently you are looking at your object of attention. Receive graphical feedback of your attention during a "focus session" you create: take back control of where you place your attention.
How To Run: download the required modules below, then 1) download the .dat file that contains dlib's pre-trained parameters for the facial landmarking algorithm 2) download the .xml file that contains the pre-trained parameters for cv2's facial classifier
Required Modules: dlib, cv2, numpy, sklearn, PIL
